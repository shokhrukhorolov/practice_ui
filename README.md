# 📱 UI Practices

Welcome to **UI Practices** — my personal project where I practice daily and sharpen my skills in **Dart** and **Flutter**.  
The main goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation that I can apply in real-world projects.

## 📂 Project Structure

Inside the `lib/` folder you will find two main directories:

### 1️⃣ `dart_practices/`
Here I practice the **fundamentals of Dart**.
- Variables, loops, functions, collections
- Training with [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/)
- Revisiting the basics of the language

### 2️⃣ `flutter_practices/`
Here I work on **Flutter exercises and tasks**.
- Running projects in the emulator
- Experimenting in `main.dart`
- Practicing widgets, state management, and UI components

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is for **myself**, to:
- practice Dart and Flutter fundamentals every day
- strengthen my coding habits
- prepare for more advanced tasks and real-world projects

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Dart
- Flutter


--- additionally, somedays I am learning theory and covering fundamentals just because I have no access to my laptop(since I often travel, and it is unsafe, to take my laptop with me)
